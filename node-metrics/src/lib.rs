//! # Node Validator Service
//!
//! The Node Validator Service is a general purpose relay service that watches
//! data flow from the Hot Shot protocol via the CDN pub sub service. It
//! maintains a local state of the network map and is able to relay the
//! stored details to any client that requests it. In addition it is also
//! able to provide individual state change updates to any client that
//! subscribes to that particular event stream.  In order to be able to
//! provide identity information to the clients, this identity information
//! must be volunteered by the nodes in the network.  This requires the
//! nodes to be able to receive and respond to these requests, and relay
//! to anyone who desires it, the identity information of the node.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! In order for this service to be effective and efficient it needs to be
//! able to store the state of the network in an efficient manner.  The
//! storage should be fast and efficient.  We are not expecting a lot of
//! data to be stored within this storage, but as things tend to grow and
//! change it may be necessary to have more robust storage mechanisms in
//! place, or even to have the ability to introduce new storage mechanisms.
//! In order to effectively store the data that we need to store, we need
//! to ask a fundamental question:
//!
//! What states do we need to track?
//! 1. Node Information
//!    * Node Identity Information
//!    * Node State Information (specifically voter participation, latest block
//!      information, and staking information)
//! 2. Network Information
//!    * Latest Block
//!    * The most recent N blocks (N assumed to be 50 at the moment)
//!      - Information can be derived from these most recent 50 blocks
//!        that allows us to derive histogram data, producer data, and
//!        the most recent block information.  We might be able to get away
//!        with just storing the header information of these blocks, since we
//!        don't need the full block data.
//!    * The most recent N votes participants
//!    * The top block producers over the latest N blocks
//!    * Histogram data for the latest N blocks
//!      - Block Size
//!      - Block Time
//!      - Block Space Used
//!
//! ## Data Streams
//!
//! In order for clients to be able to receive the information from the node
//! validator service, we need to be able to facilitate requests.  We could
//! simply just start streaming data to the clients as soon as they connect,
//! however, this causes potential compatibility issues with the clients
//! in question.  For example, if we want to add a new data stream that
//! can be retrieved for the client, and the client isn't expecting it, they
//! won't know how to handle the data, and it can potentially cause errors.
//! As such, it makes sense to only provide data streams when the client asks
//! for them.  This allows for new features to be added to the data stream
//! without breaking compatibility with the clients, provided that the existing
//! streams don't change in a way that would break the client.
//!
//! Starting out, there doesn't need to be a lot of data that needs to be
//! streamed to to the client.  In fact, we might be able to be a little
//! naive about this, and broadcast general objects in an event stream, as
//! data may be derivable from the objects that are broadcast.  For example,
//! if we start out by sending the latest N block information, the client
//! may be able to derive histogram data from that information, which would
//! prevent us from having to send and store the histogram data.  However,
//! there may be some pieces of data that are lacking from this approach which
//! would require us to send out additional data streams.
//!
//! Ideally, we should strive for a balance between the data we store locally
//! and the data that we stream to the clients. In order to know what we
//! need to store, we need to know what data we are expecting the client to
//! consume, and which data can be derived for these purposes.
//!
//! What Data Streams do we need to provide to clients?
//!
//! 1. Node Information
//!    * Node Identity Information
//!      - Should be able to be sent in an initial batch
//!      - Should be able to send individual updates as they occur
//!    * Node State Information
//!      - Should be able to be sent in an initial batch
//!      - Should be able to send individual updates as they occur
//!    * Block Information
//!      - Should be able to be sent in an initial batch
//!      - Should be able to send individual updates as they occur
